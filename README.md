# Code Refactor Starter Code
At first I saw alot of divs, so I change them to headers, sections, and footer.
next, I saw was that there was a mising id to search-engine-optimization, so i added one there
then, i spaced them out to make it more readible 
i checked to see if their is anything in the style.css, the span in the header was a little confusing because i don't know to remove it or to add color to it, so i added color to it 
also added nav elements to the unlisted elements to make it nice and clear 
## hopefully i get a good grade on this
